        <h2>Spooky Dracula Excerpt!</h2>

        <div>
            <p>"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!" I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.</p>

            <p>Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--</p>
            
            <p>"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all night. We don't mean to take any chances!"</p>
            
            <p>His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--</p>
            
            <p>"Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.</p>
            
            <p>4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--</p>
            
            <p>"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once."</p>
            
            <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
