        <h2>The power of Image Hover Effects!</h2>

        <div>
            <p> Image hover effects in web design is used for various purposes, ranging from a style choice, to conveying information on a web page in a unique manner. </p>

            <p> One example of an image hover effect that provides a positive benefit to a website is displaying things like captions when hovering over an image. This can help your website provide context or storytelling to an image without cluttering the interface. </p>
            
            <p> Another cool way to use a hover effect is through image zooming. When hovering over an image and providing the zoom effect, it will zoom in on the image which can help the viewer view the image better.</p>
            
            <p> Another example that i've found while researching this topic is that you can apply image filters upon viewing an image! You can use color filters when hovering over an image which can create a more visually pleasing effect. This is especially helpful if it is an artist's website or for photographers who would like to show their image through a filter!</p>
            
            <p> A clever usage of a hover effect is having before and after images of the same picture. Your base image can be something before it is done, and then hovering over the image can change it to the final product that you would like to showcase! This technique can be used for almost any website to show growth or change to the viewers.</p>
            <p> I've learned from a blog by Anna Fitzgerald that you can also use hover effects to add fun animations to images like a bounch effect. Transitional effects are a cool way to keep your website viewer engaged with your images!</p>
            <p>  Here, I will show you an example of how some of the things I mentioned can be used for a website. I will show a free to use picture from unsplash (taken by NEOM) and transform it through these hover effects! I applied a base filter on the image to turn it grayscale and upon hovering over the image, it reverts back to its natural color as well as popping out for some cool effects!</p>
            <img src="img/neom-DnF5nG4Fk4c-unsplash.jpg" alt="sample of hover effects!">
            <p> Aside from these techniques, using image hover effects on your website will help you align with the design standards and help keep it in tune and modernized. Using hover effects makes the browsing expereince on websites far more engaging and fun for the viewer.</p>
