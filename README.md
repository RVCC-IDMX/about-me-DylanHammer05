 ## Overview
 Welcome to my about me project! This project is a showcase of my adventure navigating through HTML and CSS for the first time. This project also shows some of my interests outside of web design through images in the gallery section as well as the biography where I talk about my hobbies!

## Description 
 This project uses HTML and CSS to structure and style my content. The navigation bar helps create a responsive and visually appealing layout. My inclusion of fonts such as "Playfair Display" and "Young Serif" adds simple yet visually pleasing fonts that enhance the overall aesthetic. 

 In the "Biography" and "Hobbies" sections, I use HTML to create sections that encaspulates my interests and helps the website viewer understand more about me from behind the screen.

 In the "Photo Gallery" section I made use of the CSS grid to showcase images of my outside life. This not only made for a more visually engaging look, but also helped me stay organized and convey to website viewers some of the things mentioned in my "hobbies" section in visual form!

 In the "Article" section I researched image hover effects on how they can be used for websites. I really enjoyed researching this topic because it taught me new ways to use and encorporate hover effects that I attempted to use in my project! I really liked to experiment with the different commands and come up with ways to use it in my website!

 The "My Video" section showcases my ability to embed multimedia elements. The responsive design in my css helped ensure a seamless viewing expereince regardless of what device you are on! I picked a rain video for my website because not only is it my original work, but it also compliments the rest of my website being calm and simple. 

 The "Contact" section features a form with netlify integration that helps any viewer easily submit a form with no difficulties. The form is simple to fill out and I even added a hover effect to the send button for more immersion and fun!

 ## Color Scheme
 The goal of my color schemes was to show a warm and fun atmosphere for all viewers. I used a main background color of Sandy Taupe (#E5C189) which gives my website a warm and earthy tone reminiscent of fun beach visits as a kid. 

 My primary text color used was Dodger Blue (#0086FF). This color is an engaging and vibrant shade of blue that compliments the sandy taupe color in the background. If sandy taupe reminds you of sand on the beach, then this color should remind you of the color of waves on the ocean and feels very lively. 

 My main Accent Color used was Apricot (#FF9C6E). I really liked this warm and light orange color because it adds a feeling of warmth throughout my website and also helps highlight key elements throughout my project without being too flashy or over the top.
